# Password Generator

## Description

A tool for employees to generate random passwords within parameters that they opt-in to. The site will prompt employees for password length (between 8 and 128 characters), whether or not they'd like to include uppercase characters, lowercase characters, numeric characters, and special characters. Once employees have made their selection of criteria, their password will be displayed in a text box ready for them to copy. If no criteria is selected then the site will generate a random password consisting of uppercase, lowercase, and numeric characters.
